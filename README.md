### Goal

This is a kids school website. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SASS in a real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Notes

You will be asked for credentials if you navigate the `student`, `teacher`, or `parent` pages. So use this name to redirect to the page

- For Example:
  - To go to student page, you should type the word `student` in the username and password fields
  - To go to teacher page, you should type the word `teacher` in the username and password fields

> You can access these pages directly from the `pages` folder

### Demo

### Technologies

- CSS
- JavaScript
- SASS

> This project is fully responsive
